A small set of GBIF API processing scripts

Quick description and example
-----------------
Due to the vast number of species in many taxon groups, manual downloading is too costly. So instead, the GBIF species and occurrence API (https://www.gbif.org/developer/species and https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence) is demonstrated here to automate the extraction of information. This series of simple standalone examples process data using the GBIF API python client.

Used to determine species' existence from a checklist and associated taxonomic match in GBIF.
